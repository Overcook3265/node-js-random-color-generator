# Random Color Generator

This is a basic color generator using the command terminal. It has two modes: running without or with user input.

## No user input

When a user enters node index.js in the command line, a block of approximately 31x9 # characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000) should be generated

## User input

The user can input colors in the structure "color hue", e.g. "red dark" or "blue light". The generator will then display a field in a color approximating this input.
